To start off, this book was just as good as I expected it to be, when I found it recommended on my instagram. The book mainly foretells old tales of the richest man in babylon, to which so a lot of people are better able gain an understanding of wealth. 

#### Initial
- The book got me wondering what my personal understnading of wealth was, and I got to the conlcusion, after conversations with carmel, that to me, wealth is about having the freedom to splurge quite abit, on multiple different wants, rather than *having to splurge* all of the money. Conclusively, it's basically that having alot of wealth is having the time, money and freedom of life, where some people would call it as financial freedom.

### The different laws
- The book foretells the lesson that could be learnt in a *fairytale* manner, based on hearing the stories of *ye olde*, and it talks in the understanding of laws, where we learn together with those that are being taught ltierally within those stories.
