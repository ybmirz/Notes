A String of characters could be further divided into various parts, and in this case of the String $S$ 

- **Prefix of $S$** : A String obtained by removing zero or more trailing symbols of string $S$
- **Suffix of $S$** : A String formed by deleting zero or more of the leading symbols of $S$
- **Substring of $S$** : A string obtained by deleting a prefix and suffix from $S$ 
> Every prefix and every suffix of s is a substring of s, but not every substring of s is a prefix or a suffix of s. 
- **Proper prefix, suffix or substring of $S$** : Any non empty string $x$ that is, respectively, a prefix, suffix or substring
- **Subsequence of $S$** : Any string formed by deleting zero or more not necessarily contiguous symbols from $S$
