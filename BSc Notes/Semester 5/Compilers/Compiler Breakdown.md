### Compiler vs Interpreter

> Note: There is a difference between an *interpreter* and a *compiler*, where the definitions are:

- **Compiler**: typically translates  
a high-level language into  
native machine code  
(hardware dependent). 
- **Interpreter**: typically  
executes high-level code  
directly.

## Phases
There's three main parts in developing a compiler for any language developed. 

1. [[Lexical Analysis]]
2. [[Syntax Analysis]]
3. [[Contextual Analysis]]
