- This module constitutes many methods, or the fundamental basis of getting deeper into Artificial Intelligence and figuring out its development throughout the years.
- It will be filled with mainly two different concepts:
	- [[Metaheuristics]], [[Heuristics]], [[Evolutionary Algorithms]] and [[Hyperheuristics]]
		- Each of these concepts would also be further explored such as algorithms applied in each concept and their components.
	- Basic information theory which involves, [[Learning from Observation]], [[Knowledge and Reasoning]], [[Modelling and Simulation]]

Starting off, it is necessary for people to understand the [[Terminologies]] given through literature review. Most of the things taught would go through various literature, to create an understanding of the concept.

### The Art of Searching
- Effective search techniques provide a mechanism to balance *exploration and exploitation*
	- Exploitation aims to greedily increase solution quality or probability
	- Exploration aims to prevent stagnation of the search process
- Aim is to design a search algorithm that can:
	- Escape the local optima!
	- Balance exploration and exploitation
	- Make the search independent from the initial configuration.
