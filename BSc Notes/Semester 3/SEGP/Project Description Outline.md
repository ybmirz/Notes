- After the discussion with Dr. Radu on the 13th (Thurs), he specified the following requirements for the outline: 
	- A **problem description** that was given to us
	- From the problem, we determine the project's **objective**
	- Further on with **how** to accomplish the objective
	- Additional **keydates** and planning on project execution
		- A **Gantt Chart** additionally to state our project plan
- With about **3-5 pages**.

---
## Keydates
- **21st October (Submission of Ethics Form and Project Description)**
- **October:** learning on the basics of android app (Java) and understanding the capabilities of Bluetooth Low Energy
- **November**: working on the prototype
- **December**: Prototype testing and Interim Report
	- Preparation for app demo

## Collaborative tools
- **Trello** will be used to track tasks and to-do lists
- **GitHub** and **Git** would be used for the collaborative aspect of the project, and hence the full project would be open source on GitHub.
- The method of development would be remote, with the delegation of tasks (with meetings only when necessary)

## Intended Prototype
- By the end of this semester, we intend to have the following ready:
	- Database ready and working
	- Rough bluetooth connection
	- Sign attendance; 
		- Lecturer Ready
		- Student Ready
- The interim report should also have a use-case and class diagram ready, along with a requirements document, denoted for our project.

## Outline

**Problem Description**: 
- We describe the problem of the project, here we can state that we are continuing the project development (or the other that we can decide on, like creating the project on our own but having a major improvement over it),, and we can elaborate on the problem and weakness that our seniors had previously (based on their report)
- Something along the lines of:
> As per a review of the previous BLE Project done by our seniors, it was stated that much more could be improved within the app and system itself, such as the proper implementation of a *network topology* in the BLE application..... 

**Objective**:
- Closely to the problem description, the objectives are meant for us to state and envision what we'd like the project to end up in and formalise it as a solution to the problem stated above.
> Based on the problem description, we can formalise that our app's objective shall be to mainly improve and add on towards the existing codebase and framework that our seniors have made. This includes....
- We can also use the **SMART** Goals approach

**Methodology:**
- An elaboration of *how* we're going to try and accomplish the above objectives, along with specifying the tools we'll be using, and the development methods we'll be applying (if any)

**Timeline**:
- A short timeline explanation to how we envision our project to be, and the amount of phases it shall go through. Specifying the *keydates* would be useful in describing our project, and additionally, Dr. Radu added on that we add in a *Gantt Chart* of the timeline that we plan for our project.
