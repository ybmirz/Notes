-  When taking images within a 3d plane, that information requires to be *digitised* and **sampling** describes
	- the *digitisation* of **spatial coordinates**
- This digitisation *determines* the **[[Resolution#Spatial Resolution]]** of a taken image.

- Generally, samples *must be taken* at a rate that is **twice** the frequency of the highest *frequency component* to be **reconstructed**.

> **Under-sampling**: sampling at a rate that is **too coarse**.
> 							but what is the *minimum rate*?
> 							We understand that it should **not** be less than the **Nyquist Rate**

- Under sampling also *may result* in **artefacts**, these are generally known [[Aliasing]]
