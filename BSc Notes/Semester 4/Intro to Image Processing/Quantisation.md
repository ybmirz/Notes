- Refers to the digitisation of the *light intensity function*
- It shall determines the *grey level*, *colour or [[Resolution#Radiometric Resolution]]*

> Similar to the an affect of *under-sampling*, we should also somehow determine the amount of *grey level to store*

- This *grey level* can also be taken as the *number* of levels of **colour/intensity** to be represented at each pixel.
	- This level of intensity is known as **Quantisation**, and often is determined per pixel

### Re-Quantisation
