- Generally occurs when **two signals** (in our case, images) become *indistinguishable* when sampled.
- Often may happen due to *under-sampling* in an image, during [[Sampling]]
	- When it comes to an image, the aliasing that could be seen are *artefacts* within the image
- In an image case, the two signals are the **true image** and **the one reconstructed by a vision system from a sampled image**
> The true image refers to the image that would be seen if there were no [[Quantisation]]

> The above shows an example of *aliasing* given two signals, in an abstract manner.
