- Simply, a language $L$ over an alphabet $\sum$ is a **subset** of $\sum^{*}$ 
	- $L \subseteq  \sum^{*}$
	- or $L \in P(\sum^{*})$
- A Language can be either a **finite** or **infinite** set
	- However, $\epsilon$ is **not always** an element of $\sum^{*}$, but it **may or may not be** an element of a  language.

As an example:
$$
\sum = \{ a,b,c \}
$$
Some languages that could be defined under this alphabet goes as follows:
$$
\{ a, abba, ba, bb \}
$$
$$
\{  c \}
$$
$$
\{ a^{n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$
$$
\dots
$$
