- This module constitutes many methods, or the fundamental basis of getting deeper into Artificial Intelligence and figuring out its development throughout the years.
- It will be filled with mainly two different concepts:
	- [[Metaheuristics]], [[Iterated Local Search]], [[Simulated Annealing]], [[Tabu Search]], [[Evolutionary Algorithms]] and [[Hyperheuristics]]
	- Basic information theory whihc involves, [[Learning from Observation]], [[Knowledge and Reasoning]], [[Modelling and Simulation]]

Starting off, it is necessary for people to understand the [[Terminologies]] given through literature review. Most of the things taught would go through various literature, to create an understanding of the concept.
