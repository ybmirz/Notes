- Heurisitic search are searches that have *heuristic* characteristics in finding the solution.
- It is a *search algorithm*
	- Figuring out how to get into a search function

## Main Components
- [[Representation]] of  a *candidate solution*
	- Finding someway to *represent* a *mock* solution
	- Also representing the operators or objects within the algorithm
- [[Evaluation Function]] otherwise known as *Objective Function*
- An Initialisation
- The [[Neighbourhoods]] relation (moving operators)
- The [[#Search Process]] itself 
- Mechanism for *escaping* from the **local optima** 
	- An example could be taken from [[Hill Climbing]]


### Max-Sat Problem
- Maximum-Satisfiability Problem refers to the *maximum* possible *satisfied clauses* given a problem instance.
	- More research necessary here
