- A **neighbourhood** of a solution *x* is the *set of solutions* that can be *reached from x* by a **simple operator move** (also known as the *move operator/heuristic*)
- There can be multiple neighbourhoods of multiple [[Representation]]s

#### NH for Binary Representation
- a **bit-flip** operator; where *a bit* is *flipped* in a *given solution*
- Using the **hamming distance** between *two-bit strings* vectors of equal length in the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols differ

> if the binary string is of size *n*, then the neighbourhood size is *n*


#### NH for Integer/Value Representation
