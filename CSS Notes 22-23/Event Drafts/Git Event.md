### Why Version Control?
- Take it literally, **version control** allows us to take *control* of code changes or *versions*; essentially variations and updates to your code!
- Generally, it is a habit or practice to track and saving individual changes software code.
- Advantages of version control:
	- Being able to **revert changes**
	- Able to *branch out* to create different versions of the code (why?)
	- Able to *go back* in the case of an error that happened during additional change to the code (much easier for us to debug and produce more efficient code)
- Why not use backup folders then? : more manual work and prone to errors!

### Version Control Systems
- To help with this practice of version control, programs and software has been made for *performing version control* called **Version Control Systems (VCS)**
- There's two types: 
	- **Centralised VCS**: Repositories (tracking of versions) are stored in a centralised remote repositories (online or a local server), and changes made by different people are tracked towards the same repository. (CVS and Subversion)
	- **Decentralised VCS**: Versions are shared from a *remote repository* to everyone's local repository, each maintaining its own history, and can sync/update with the (main) remote repository. (Git)

## Extras:
- [ ] Need to bring your own personal hdmi cable to present in the projector

## Refreshments:
- These are the refreshments that we plan to provide the participants with the following refreshments, under the budget of the School of Computer Science:
	- 100 Plus
	- A&W


**For CSS Members** (max 40 pax):
	- We plan to provide CSS members that join IDE and Git Events with **stickers** to be proud of what they have learnt during the short workshop
	- **Ferrero Rocher** for Members that join these events
