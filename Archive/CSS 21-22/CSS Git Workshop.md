## Briefing
- A Workshop focused on helping CSS members properly and truly understand Git, from what it is to how it works. It will be done by using *HTML and CSS* as the base resource, and in essence we'll also be walking through them on how to start off creating a *simple, static* website. 
- The workshop is to be **hands-on oriented** meaning most of the work would be hands on with participation from the members, with little to no theory (mostly for the Git theory initially).
	- The static website is to be designed and worked with by KAI and SAFA, they will be designing a simple one or few pages sites with proper CSS, but no interaction or animation.
	- The Git part would be worked with by me and Gabriel, making sure we cover the theory and practical usage of it.

### Rundown (Could be changed)
- Starting off with a short introduction of git (as it is the main topic of the event) and giving a few terms and usages of git (if possible without powerpoint but instead a pdf and we annotate ontop of it), and then how to install git itself. *Probably 10-20minutes*
	- Need to relearn that and try it out myself. 
- Once git is installed and we show abit of how to use git command line. like `git --ver` then we do `git init` on a repository to basically start git into a repository (for the code).
- We could then start on  creating the HTML site itself and start coding for it, in VS code, or in whatever text editor they want (Notepad++ or Notepad). HTML+CSS Code rundown and teaching program by SAFA. *30-40 minutes*
- *10 minutes break*
- We then show Github,, a remote repository website for Git repositories for people to show off their code or just general have a backup of their code over on a remote side. 
- The reason we're using Github is because they offer Github Pages where we're basically able to host our website that we recently just made on Github with no manual hosting required! *20-30 minutes*

## Details:
- 18th March 2022 4:00pm
- Probably 2 hour now.
- What to expect, Git Command Line usage and understanding (enough to be able to work with remote repositories and restore changes made to code), creating a simple and static website with HTML and CSS, and then pushing the repository to Github to be able to host the site over on Github with Github Pages!


### Git topics to be discussed
- Briefly describe **what is a version control system** and **distributed version control system**, example of this dvcs is **git**.
	- Main reason people use git
- Terminologies to understand 
	- Repositories
	- Staging Area (and Working Directory)
	- Commits (and the HEAD pointer)
	- Branches
	- Clone
	- Pull and Push
- Help visualize how Git branching, merging and rebasing works using drawings and diagrams.

- Installing and Setting up the Git command line
	- Connecting github account with git command line
	- git init

> Create the website with the audience, simple and static website

- Connecting github repository with the local repository of the site
- Pushing the code onto the Github repository and then using Github pages to show the site under a proper url, and see their work published!



##### Content Creation Assignment
- Gabriel create **vcs notes** and **git branching**
- Miru creaete **git ppt**, **git terms** and **installing**
- Safa creates **html ppt**
- Kai edits the website to be more beginner friendly

## Script

- Introductory ice breaking 
	- simple enough just wanna know *why they wanna learn how to use git* cos I'm under the assumption that they know what Git is!
	- it'd be nicer if they've already known how to code in HTML and CSS.

- Give them a short structure of the entire workshop, stating **hands on experience** and we'll be showing them *how to create a sample static website* to be used as code material to track using Git! and then pushing them to the remote repository and hosting over Github Pages.

- Talk about **version control** and **version control systems** and then basic *Git terminologies* and  understanding of what Git actually is.

- **Local Git Areas** and *how exactly* Git tracks your code, and the different *areas* Git uses to represent and track code versions. and then talk about **Basic Git workflow** and how to use it.

- After understanding what and how git works generally, can start installing and downloading Git bash, quickly show them and if needed for them, they could just watch a recording whilst i go on for the next basic topic

- **Start website dev theory** from the different website technologies used in making a website, and diving into simple basics,, apologize to those who've used html and css before, but we'll just be using the codebase to understand and use git.


- From there get into starting to code the website, based on Safa's script and create the code with the audience hands on and at the same time using Git to keep track of things and understanding how Git command line works.

- Short look into **Branching** in Git, but we'll not be using Git branching for this workshop but there are references in the slides that poeple could watch and understand how to use branching, here we'd just help them visualize and get started as they got an understanding of Git workflow.

- Once that is done, we'd start by creating a Github repository with them and connecting the Github repository as the remote repo to our local git repo that we've been working on and then pushing all the code into the remote repo and then hosting it with a few clicks on Github pages!
