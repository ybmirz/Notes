Similar to how regular languages can be conveniently defined using regular expressions; context-free languages can be defined using [[Context-Free Grammar]].

- Context free grammar is able to generate strings in a context-free language; which then can be accepted by a PDA

### Definition

- The language generated by a CFG $G = (N, \sum, P , S)$ is defined as:
$$
L (G) = \{  w | ( w \in \sum^{*}) \land (S \Rightarrow^{+}_{G}{} w) \}
$$
> A word is accepted into the language generated by $G$ if the word being part of the greater input alphabet and this word is *one or more derivation* from the starting symbol in the CFG $G$

#### Sentential Forms
- any string of terminal and non-terminal symbols that can be derived from the start symbol is a sentential form;
$$
\alpha \in \left( N \cup \sum \right)^{*} \iff S \Rightarrow ^{*} \alpha
$$
> $\alpha$ here is an example of a sentential form; All the words in the language are sentential forms but not all sentential forms words are in the language.

#### Leftmost Derivation
- If a derivation always applies productions to the leftmost non-terminal symbol of the sentential form, then it is called a leftmost derivation.
- The symbol that can be used is $\Rightarrow_{lm}$
hence $\alpha \in (N \cup \sum)^{*} \iff S \Rightarrow_{lm}^{*}{\alpha}$ is called a *left-sentential form*

#### Rightmost Derivation
- Hence, if a derivation always applies productions to the rightmost non-terminal symbol of the sentential form, then it is called the right most derivation;
$$
\alpha \in \left( N \cup \sum \right)^{*} \iff S \Rightarrow_{rm}^{*}{\alpha}
$$
is known as the *right-sentential form*
