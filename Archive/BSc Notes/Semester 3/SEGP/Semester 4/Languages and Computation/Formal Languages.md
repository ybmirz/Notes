> Formal languages are not described within the module; hence an understanding will be taken from online.

From Dictionary.com, a formal language is a language designed for use in *specific situations* and in this module, is designed to solve problems; or moving from an initial state to an end state. 

Formal languages are used as tools for various disciplines, however the theory is mainly concerned with the study of various *types of language formalisms*, in our case;
- strings generated by a **formal grammar**
- or strings generated or matched by a **particular regular expressions**
- or strings that could be accepted by an **automaton**; such as a Turing machine, or a finite-state automaton
	- which further develops into the automata theory
