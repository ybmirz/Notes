Getting started in Machine Learning starts off by understanding data and its [[#Data Structure]]

## Data Structure
- in its original state, data can have multiple sources and uncertainty (such as distorted or missing entries)
- In most cases, we will assume that data is structured as a table where the **rows are instances** and the columns are **features (attributes)**
	- in certain cases, instances will have *one or more labels* associated with them; also known as a **class**

> As a refresher; Supervised learning can be done with well-labeled and structured data, whilst unsupervised learning is done without labeled data.

In ML, *data points* consists of a *feature and label* **tuple** $\{x,y\}$
These data points can be used to learn a [[Hypothesis]] $h$ or a find a [[#Pattern]] $g$

## Pattern
- A pattern can be defined as anything that follows a *trend* and exhibits some kind of regularity.
- **Pattern Recognition** is a data analysis method that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically recognise patterns
	- Can either be unsupervised or supervised.
