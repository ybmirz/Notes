A hypothesis is a specific **statement** of prediction.

- A model can *approximate* the target function and performs mappings of inputs to outputs.
- The choice of model and the configuration of the model defines the **space of possible** hypothesis that the model may represent
- Not all studies have hypotheses. Sometimes a study is designed to *find a hypothesis*
