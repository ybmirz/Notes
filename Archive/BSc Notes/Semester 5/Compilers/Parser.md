> The interaction between the Lexical Analyzer and the Parser is that the parser retrieves the token and its attributes

A component in *lexical analysis* where a set of tokens is analysed into becoming a *syntax tree based on a grammar*. It should be noted that the lexer achieves the *set of tokens* from the input string.

### Methods
Two main methods of parsing, where it follows a **top-down approach** or **bottom-up**.

### Top-Down Parsing

#### Bottom-Up Parsing
